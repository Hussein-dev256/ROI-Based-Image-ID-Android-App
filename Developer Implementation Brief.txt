# ObjectID Web Demo – Developer Implementation Brief

**(Android → Web Feature Parity & UX Expectations)**

## 1. Context & Purpose (Read This First)

I am building **ObjectID**, an AI-powered object recognition system.
The **Android app is the primary product**, and it uses **Imagga API** to identify objects from **user-selected regions of interest (ROI)** in images.

The purpose of this **web-based demo** is **not** to replace the Android app, but to:

* Reproduce the **exact Android workflow**
* Allow **recruiters and portfolio visitors** to experience the system
* Demonstrate **engineering thinking, UX maturity, and AI integration**
* Work without installing anything

⚠️ This web demo must **feel intentional, polished, and interactive**, not like a basic file uploader.

---

## 2. Core UX Philosophy

This demo should feel like:

* Google Lens (simplified)
* Apple Vision-style interaction
* A guided AI experience

It should **not** feel like:

* A raw HTML form
* A static canvas
* A minimal prototype

---

## 3. Typography & Visual Direction

* **Primary Font:** `Poppins` (required)
* Font weights:

  * Headings: 600–700
  * Body: 400–500
* Style:

  * Dark UI
  * Glassmorphism
  * Soft gradients (blue → purple)
  * Rounded corners (12–16px)
  * Smooth transitions (150–250ms)

Typography must help establish **credibility and modernity**.

---

## 4. My Current Pain Points (These MUST be fixed)

### 4.1 UI Quality

* Current UI feels **empty and unfinished**
* Too minimal → looks like a prototype
* No clear hierarchy or guidance

👉 The UI must have **visual density**, structure, and flow.

---

### 4.2 Image Handling (Major Issue)

* Uploaded images **expand uncontrollably**
* Makes annotation extremely difficult
* No fixed viewing stage

👉 **Fix:**
Images must live inside a **bounded image stage / viewport**:

* Fixed max width & height
* Image scales to fit (maintain aspect ratio)
* Support zoom & pan **inside** the stage
* Never overflow the container

---

### 4.3 Annotation Canvas (Critical)

The annotation rectangle is currently:

* Not movable freely
* Not resizable
* Not interactive
* Not intuitive

👉 **This is unacceptable for an ROI-based system**

The annotation canvas **must** support:

* Dragging (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
* Resizing from all corners and edges
* Minimum & maximum size constraints
* Cursor feedback (move / resize)
* Semi-transparent fill
* Clear handles
* Smooth pointer-based interaction (mouse + touch)

This should feel like:

* Figma
* Photoshop
* Mobile crop tools

---

## 5. Required Pages / Screens (Web Demo Flow)

### 5.1 Landing / Upload Screen

Purpose:

* Set expectations
* Invite interaction

Must include:

* Clear CTA: “Select an Image”
* Secondary CTA: “Try sample image”
* Short explainer:

  > “Upload an image and highlight the object you want identified.”

---

### 5.2 Image Stage Screen

Purpose:

* Prepare image for annotation

Requirements:

* Fixed image container
* Dark backdrop
* Zoom in / out controls
* Reset view button

No annotation yet — just image preparation.

---

### 5.3 Annotation Mode

Purpose:

* User selects ROI

Must include:

* Interactive annotation rectangle
* Instructional hint:

  > “Drag to move • Pull corners to resize”
* Reset annotation option
* Visual confirmation when ROI is valid

---

### 5.4 Processing Screen

Purpose:

* Reassure user AI is working

Must include:

* Loading indicator
* Blurred or dimmed background
* Text:

  > “Identifying selected object…”

---

### 5.5 Results Screen

Purpose:

* Display AI output clearly

Must include:

* Top 3 predictions from Imagga
* Confidence scores
* Progress bars or visual indicators
* Highlight the highest confidence result

Actions:

* Identify another object
* Go back home
* Exit demo

---

## 6. Android → Web Feature Parity (Line by Line)

| Android App Feature   | Web Demo Equivalent     | Status Expectation |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Image from gallery    | Upload image            | Required           |
| Camera capture        | Optional (if supported) | Nice-to-have       |
| Image size threshold  | Client-side validation  | Required           |
| ROI annotation        | Interactive canvas      | Required           |
| Draggable ROI         | Drag in all directions  | Required           |
| Resizable ROI         | Corners + edges         | Required           |
| ROI cropping          | Canvas-based crop       | Required           |
| API request to Imagga | Same request logic      | Required           |
| Top 3 results         | Display top 3           | Required           |
| Confidence scores     | Visible percentages     | Required           |
| Retry / reset         | Reset buttons           | Required           |
| Exit flow             | Home / close            | Required           |

⚠️ If any Android feature is missing on web, it must be **intentionally justified**, not ignored.

## 7. Technical Expectations (High-Level)

* Do **not** reinvent annotation logic
* Use a proven canvas approach:

  * Konva.js / Fabric.js / similar
* ROI must be extracted accurately
* Only ROI is sent to Imagga (not full image)
* Compress images before upload
* Clear loading & error states

---

## 8. Responsiveness (Non-Negotiable)

This demo must work on:

* Desktop (primary)
* Tablets
* Mobile browsers

Responsive behavior:

* Image stage scales, not breaks
* Annotation still usable on touch
* Buttons remain reachable
* No overflow or clipping

---

## 9. Error States I Don’t Want Forgotten

Handle these explicitly:

* Image too large
* No annotation selected
* Annotation too small
* API failure
* Network issues

Each must show:

* Clear message
* Recovery action

---

## 10. Final Expectation

This web demo is **not about features alone**.

It must demonstrate:

* UX thinking
* Parity with mobile
* AI workflow clarity
* Engineering maturity

If a recruiter spends **3 minutes** on this demo, they should immediately understand:

* What ObjectID does
* Why ROI-based identification matters
* That this system is thoughtfully built
