# 📌 Product Brief — ObjectID Portfolio Showcase

## 1. The Problem (Business + Product Perspective)

Right now, **ObjectID exists only as an APK**.

From a **user / recruiter / client** perspective:

* They cannot preview the product instantly
* They must trust and install an APK (high friction, low trust)
* They cannot experience ObjectID alongside your other live projects
* Your strongest work looks *less impressive* than weaker projects that have live demos

From a **portfolio conversion** perspective:

* APK-only projects underperform
* Visitors bounce instead of engaging
* You lose credibility despite solid engineering

👉 **The problem is not ObjectID.
The problem is how it is presented.**

---

## 2. Product Goal (What We Are Fixing)

**Primary Goal**

> Make ObjectID instantly usable from the browser with zero installation.

**Secondary Goals**

* Keep the existing Android app untouched
* Avoid re-training models
* Minimize cost and hosting dependencies
* Make ObjectID look like a *real product*, not a student demo

**Non-Goals**

* We are NOT replacing the Android app
* We are NOT rebuilding the entire system
* We are NOT chasing perfect UI before functionality

---

## 3. Solution Overview (What We Will Build)

We will build a **Web-based ObjectID Demo**, with a **future path to PWA**.

### High-Level Flow

```
Portfolio → Live Demo → Upload Image → Model Inference → Results
```

### Key Principle

> The web demo is a **presentation layer**, not a rewrite.

---

## 4. Architecture Decision (Why This Approach)

### Chosen Approach: **API-backed Web Demo**

**Why**

* Fastest time to value
* Reuses existing inference logic
* Lowest risk
* Easiest to debug
* Clean separation of concerns

### Architecture

```
Frontend (Web)
   ↓
Inference API (FastAPI or NestJS)
   ↓
TensorFlow Lite Model
   ↓
Prediction Response
```

---

## 5. Developer Execution Plan (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1 — Stabilize the Core (DO NOT SKIP)

**Objective**
Ensure your current inference logic is stable and reusable.

**Tasks**

* Extract image preprocessing into a standalone function
* Extract model loading into a singleton/service
* Define a single inference function:

```text
input: image
output: { label, confidence[] }
```

**Rules**

* No UI work yet
* No optimization yet
* No refactoring unrelated code

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Given the same image, APK and API return the same results

---

### Phase 2 — Build the Inference API

**Objective**
Expose ObjectID as a service.

**Endpoint**

```
POST /identify
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

**Request**

* image file
* optional flags (top_k, threshold)

**Response**

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    { "label": "Dog", "confidence": 0.92 }
  ]
}
```

**Non-Negotiables**

* Input validation
* File size limits
* Timeouts
* Error handling (no stack traces to client)

---

### Phase 3 — Build the Web Demo UI

**Objective**
Allow instant interaction.

**UI Scope**

* Image upload
* Preview
* “Identify” button
* Results list

**Out of Scope**

* Auth
* History
* Styling perfection

**Rule**

> If it doesn’t help understanding ObjectID, it doesn’t get built.

---

### Phase 4 — Portfolio Integration

**Objective**
Make ObjectID visible and impressive.

**Project Card Must Include**

* Live Demo
* Short explanation
* Tech stack
* Link to APK
* Link to GitHub

**CTA Priority**

1. Live Demo
2. Case Study
3. APK Download

---

## 6. Risk Management (How We Avoid Breaking Things)

### Rule #1 — APK is Sacred

* No changes to the existing Android code
* No shared mutable code
* No forced refactors

---

### Rule #2 — Feature Flags

* Web demo uses its own config
* Separate model path if needed
* Environment-based switching

---

### Rule #3 — Validation Parity

Before deployment:

* Test same image on:

  * Android app
  * API
* Compare labels and confidence ranges

---

### Rule #4 — Performance Guardrails

* Max image size enforced
* CPU inference only
* Timeout hard limit (e.g. 5s)

---

## 7. Quality Checklist (Definition of “Done”)

✅ Web demo loads in < 3 seconds
✅ Image inference < 5 seconds
✅ No crashes on invalid input
✅ APK remains unchanged
✅ Live link works from portfolio
✅ Clear explanation visible

---

## 8. Future Enhancements (NOT NOW)

Document only — do not implement yet:

* PWA offline mode
* Camera capture
* On-device inference (TF.js)
* Model switching
* Dataset expansion

---

## 9. Final Instruction to Developer

> Treat ObjectID like a **product**, not a project.
> The web demo exists to **sell your competence**, not to be perfect.

Build **small**, **stable**, and **presentable**.
